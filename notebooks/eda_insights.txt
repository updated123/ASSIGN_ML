Marketplace EDA – Structured Insights Report
================================================================================

1. MAIN PATTERNS OBSERVED
------------------------------------------------------------
- Order status is dominated by 'delivered'; other statuses are minority.
- Review scores are integer 1-5 only (one per order, latest review); right-skewed (many 4-5); low scores (1-3) are a minority.
- Delivery delay (delivered vs estimated date) shows a meaningful late rate.
- Payment mix is concentrated in credit_card and boleto.
- Order value, freight, and item count have positive skew (long upper tails).
- Review coverage among delivered orders is high but not 100%.

2. KEY OPERATIONAL DRIVERS
------------------------------------------------------------
- Delivery performance (on-time vs late) drives review scores (late -> lower scores).
- Category and seller identity are strong drivers of late delivery rate.
- Order size (item count, value, freight) may correlate with delay and satisfaction.
- Time (year/month) reflects seasonality and growth.

3. STRONGEST RELATIONSHIPS DISCOVERED
------------------------------------------------------------
- Late delivery vs review: late orders mean score 2.56 vs on-time 4.29.
- Order value and freight are highly correlated (freight scales with value/category).
- Late rate varies by product category and by seller (actionable levers).

4. UNEXPECTED FINDINGS
------------------------------------------------------------
- Some orders have multiple payment types (payment_type_list); primary used for EDA.
- Negative delivery_delay_days (early delivery) are common; late = positive delay.
- Review coverage < 100% implies missing-not-at-random risk for review models.

5. POTENTIAL ML PROBLEM CANDIDATES
------------------------------------------------------------

  (A) Late delivery prediction (binary: late_delivery_flag)
      Target: order delivered after estimated_delivery_date. Positive rate ~ 8.1%.
      Strengths: Clear target; rich features (category, seller, value, time).
      Weaknesses: Label only known after delivery; possible data quality in dates.
      Modeling risks: Temporal leakage if not split by time; seller/category imbalance.

  (B) Low review score prediction (e.g. score <= 3 vs 4-5)
      Target: review_score <= 3. Positive rate (low) ~ 22.9%; high (4-5) ~ 77.1%.
      Strengths: Direct customer satisfaction signal; link to delivery and order features.
      Weaknesses: Missing reviews (coverage 99.3%); possible non-response bias.
      Modeling risks: Class imbalance (few low scores); text/comment not used in this EDA.

  CLASS IMBALANCE (review score)
------------------------------------------------------------
  - Corrected distribution uses integer scores 1-5 only (latest review per order; no averaging).
  - Counts: Score 1: 11364, Score 2: 3129, Score 3: 8133, Score 4: 19045, Score 5: 57002.
  - Binary low (1-3) vs high (4-5): minority class ~22.9%; majority ~77.1%.
  - Implications: (1) Binary classifiers may need class weight or resampling to avoid predicting majority always. (2) Multi-class (5-way) is heavily imbalanced (Score 5 dominates); consider macro F1 or per-class metrics. (3) Rare scores (1, 2) are hardest to predict; more data or focal loss may help.

  (C) Order value prediction (regression or segment)
      Target: total_order_value (continuous) or high-value segment.
      Strengths: Strong business actionability; item_count and category are strong signals.
      Weaknesses: Payment value may double-count with item price; multi-item aggregation.
      Modeling risks: Heavy tail; need train/val split by time.
