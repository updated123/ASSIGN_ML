LEARNINGS SUMMARY
============================================================
Model: xgboost
Test Macro-F1: 0.2430
Test Weighted-F1: 0.4346

Findings from comparing baseline LR vs stronger model:
 - Macro-F1 is primary for imbalanced multi-class; accuracy is misleading.
 - Per-class recall (especially 1-star) matters for detecting bad reviews.
 - Temporal split avoids future leakage and gives realistic performance.
