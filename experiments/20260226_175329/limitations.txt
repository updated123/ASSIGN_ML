PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS
============================================================

1. Class imbalance (5-star dominant ~58%)
   - Model may under-predict rare classes (1, 2). Per-class recall for 1-star
     is critical; monitor it in production.

2. Subjective nature of reviews
   - Same experience can yield 4 vs 5; label noise limits ceiling.

3. Possible non-response bias
   - Not all delivered orders have reviews; reviewers may differ from non-reviewers.

4. Seller-level skew
   - Many sellers with few orders; historical aggregates can be noisy for them.

5. Temporal drift risk
   - Behavior and mix can change; retrain periodically and monitor macro-F1.

When predictions should NOT be fully trusted:
 - New sellers/categories (no or little history).
 - Rare segments (e.g. very high order value, unusual category).
 - If per-class recall for 1-star is low, do not rely on model to flag all bad reviews.
